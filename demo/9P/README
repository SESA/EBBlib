You need to put ufs and ixpc in a bin directory whereever you
put this directory (or set EBBAPP_BASEDIR to).

USAGE: ebbapp [-h] [-v] [-a appid] [-i <frontend ip>] <nodeip>

For the moment assumes that you have a worker node booted with
a reachable ip address specified on the command line.

Need to integrate with node allocation and eventually support 
other addresses than tcp addressed nodes
