You need to put ufs and ixpc in a bin directory whereever you
put this directory (or set EBBAPP_BASEDIR to).

---

ixpc:

You can find ixpc in ebb/libs/libixp-0.5. As part of the ebb lib build process 
a make of the libixp should happen and you should get ebb/libs/libixp/cmd/ixpc.O
copy this binary to bin dir 

ufs: 

You will need to clone the npfs repo and build ufs:

$ svn co https://npfs.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/npfs npfs
$ cd npfs/spfs/trunk
$ make

You should get a binary npfs/spfs/trunk/fs/ufs copy this to the bin dir

-----

USAGE: ebbapp [-h] [-v] [-a appid] [-i <frontend ip>] <nodeip>

For the moment assumes that you have a worker node booted with
a reachable ip address specified on the command line.

Need to integrate with node allocation and eventually support 
other non-tcp addressed nodes (eg. ethernet, bg: collective/torus)
