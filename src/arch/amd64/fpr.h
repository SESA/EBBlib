/* DS: I find this to be wrong, x86-64 stack is 16 byte aligned at */
/* fuction entry so adding a spare 8 bytes causes an alignment */
/* problem */

/* On the X86-64, the stack is 8-byte aligned, and kept that way
 * by all stack operations.  The fxsave/fxrstor instructions save
 * all the floating point registers at one time (512 bytes
 * worth).  It would seem useful to save all the floating pointer
 * registers on the stack at times.  However, the fxsave/fxrstor
 * instructions require their address to be 16-byte aligned.  To
 * solve this, we always save/restore the floating point
 * registers on the stack by the
 * SAVE_FLOAT_ON_STACK/RESTORE_FLOAT_FROM_STACK macros.  These
 * macros are responsible for whatever is necessary to keep
 * things working.

 * When we push the registers on the stack, we may (or may not)
 * need to push an extra 8-bytes to get things aligned before we
 * can use the fxsave instruction.  The problem comes when we
 * restore.  After the fxrstor instruction, we may (or may not)
 * need to take the extra 8-byte off the stack.

 * If we sometimes need an extra 8-bytes, and sometimes don't,
 * the size of the floating point register save area becomes
 * variable sized.  This causes all sorts of problems.  So we
 * want the save area to be of fixed size.  To do that, we always
 * make the floating point register save area 8 bytes too big.
 * If the save area is 16-byte aligned, we save the FPR at the
 * beginning of the save area.  If the save area is off by
 * 8-bytes, then we save the FPR offset by 8-bytes in the save
 * area, so that they are 16-byte aligned.
 *
 * So the floating point register save area is always a fixed
 * size (and aligned on an 8-byte boundary), but the location of
 * the actual floating point registers in the save area varies.
 * As a result, you can never access them directly, but only thru
 * the following macros to save and restore them.
