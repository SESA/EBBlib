o In fusion, go to windows, click on VM, and say show in finder, then
  duplicate it.
o open the VM from fusion
o when you try to run it, fusion will ask if you moved the VM, or
  copied it. If you tell copy, a new mac address will be generated
  (and UUID).
o you can also create a new mac address by clicking on advanced
  options under networking, and say generate a new mac address
o grab the mac address and modify the DHCP service in fusion:
/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/vmnet8/dhcpd.conf
by adding something like this:
host lsesa1 {
        hardware ethernet 00:50:56:34:7B:57;
        fixed-address 172.16.33.11;
}
Where:
  o lsesa1 is name of new machine, and the mac address is that of the
  new VM, and the IP address is the one you are assigning to it. Make
  sure that the IP address is in the same subnet as the other victims

o You might need to go into your networking options, and change the
network back to a NAT network, for some reason it changed to a host
only network for me. 
o You might want to add something like the following to your
.ssh/config file
Host lsesa1
	Hostname 172.16.33.11
	User sesa
Modify your /etc/hosts file all your clients to have something like
this:
172.16.33.1 lhost lhost.local
172.16.33.10 lsesa0 lsesa0.local
172.16.33.11 lsesa1 lsesa1.local
172.16.33.12 lsesa2 lsesa2.local
172.16.33.13 lsesa3 lsesa3.local
172.16.33.14 lsesa4 lsesa4.local
