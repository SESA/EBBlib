Discussions to be promoted into jobjar items once we have decided on them:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
o how do we want to return errors.  Proposal, we adopt 1/2 of what K42
  did, i.e., an error is negative space.  With an error we have three
  values:
  1. a generic error that comes from unix
  2. a class specific error that can be responded to
  3. a relatively unique system wide number that is ored in to the
     error
o unit testing model
o get counter example working again
o C++
o bare metal environment
  o look at openboot
  o bare metal on xen
o message passing cross node
o extend EBB miss to work over messages
o ethernet support
o get distributed counter example across nodes
o port to blue gene
o start on medical example
o management plane, front end working programatically against blue
  gene and vcloud  
o enabled mode programming model:
  o threads
  o blocking locks
o proper implementation of memory allocator
o port over scientific applications
o ulinux cludge for per-processor mappings for translation table
  (i.e., allocate per-processor memory).
