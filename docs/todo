Discussions to be promoted into TODO items once we have decided on them:
o how do we want to return errors.  Proposal, we adopt 1/2 of what K42
  did, i.e., an error is negative space.  With an error we have three
  values:
  1. a generic error that comes from unix
  2. a class specific error that can be responded to
  3. a relatively unique system wide number that is ored in to the
     error
o what do we want the makefile, configuration model to look like???
o unit testing model

Naming conventions:
o most things are EBBs, so lets not bother with "EBB" at the beginning
  of name
o We will capitalize first letter of a name that is a class
