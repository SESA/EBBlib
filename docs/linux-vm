When you are done, key things to remember:
o your host will be "lhost" to all the vms
o you will have mounted your /User directory from mac on all the VMs as /User, 
o VMs will be called lsesa0, lsesa1, lsesa2...


Directions for getting a new machine:
o Go to VMware.com, download fusion
  vmware fusion, install, trial
o go to http://www.ubuntu.com/
  latest amd64 server, (11.10)
o created new vm, point fusion to the ISO you just downloaded
  o to minimize memory, switch to 512MB of RAM, rest default (NAT, 20Gig disk)
o copy the VM using the file system
o on client, create user
  o user: sesa
  o password: sesa0000sesa
o on client, (note, for everything do as sudo)
  apt-get install openssh-server
  apt-get install build-essential
  apt-get install nfs-client
  (I also installed emacs)


o set up fixed IP addresses everywhere:
  o For Fusion version 4, go to:
   /Library/Preferences/VMware\ Fusion/
  o modify vmnet8 which is the local natted network, in 
/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/vmnet8/dhcpd.conf
  o Note, in everything below, replace 172.16.XX with your isolated subnet
Add the following:
--------------------
host lsesa0 {
	hardware ethernet XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX;
	fixed-address 172.16.XX.10;
}
--------------------
o Where you can get the correct mac address for your client by doing an
  ifconfig on it or looking at the vmx file.  
o if you quit and restat fusion, it will restart the dhcp service. 
o add new client to your .ssh/config file, e.g.;
--------------------
Host lsesa0
	Hostname 172.16.XX.10
	User sesa
--------------------
o on client modify /etc/hosts, call host "lhost", and names
for client, e.g., lsesa0, lsesa1...
--------------------
172.16.XX.1 lhost lhost.local
172.16.XX.10 lsesa0 lsesa0.local
172.16.XX.11 lsesa1 lsesa1.local
--------------------
o on client modify /etc/fstab to mount Users from host file system as /mnt/hostfs
--------------------
lhost:/Users    /mnt/hostfs     nfs     rw
--------------------
o on server export file system, in /etc/exports, the network mask sys 
--------------------
/Users -mapall=XXXUSERXXX -alldirs -network 172.16.XX -mask 255.255.255.0
--------------------
where: 
  above will map all users to be the local user (XXX...) 


o create a symbolic ink from /Users to /mnt/hostfs, so that the
  address is the same

on your box, set up your emacs to remotely compile to linux, e.g.
(setq remote-compile-user "sesa")
(setq remote-compile-host "lsesa0")
(setq remote-shell-program "/opt/local/bin/ssh")

to remote compile, you will need to cd to the right directory in the
target side, e.g., 
^X remote-compile, then type in "cd /Users/okrieg/SESA/EBBlib/libs/ebb/ ; SESA_LRT=ulnx SESA_ARCH=amd64 make -f ebbtest.mk"
