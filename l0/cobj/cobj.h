// cObj: CObjects A simple C component infrastructure 
//   There is no attempt to support complex OOP concepts or abstractions
//   rather just basic support for creating components that define 
//   a vtable of functions and associated data.   There is no direct support
//   for either interface or implementation inheritance.  However, there
//   is obvious ways to create vtables which are aggregates.  You may of course
//   use your own conventions to support inheritance.
