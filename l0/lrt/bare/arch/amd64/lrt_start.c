//We get here after some very early initialization occurs:
// 1. grub boots us into start.S, we put ourselves on a small boot
//     stack and call init32 in init32.c
// 2. init32.c sets up enough paging to idempotently map the first
//     4 GB of memory, enables long mode and the GDT then jumps to init64
//     which is in a 64 bit code segment in init64.c
// 3. init64.c initializes the "pic" and sends an ipi to ourself which goes
//     through lrt_start_isr.S and then gets here

//We assume the early boot stack is enough until later on when, for example,
// the event manager gets us on an event and an associated stack.
