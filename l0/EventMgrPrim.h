/*
 * The Event Manager (EM) is one of the primordial objects.  The EM
 * will be a fully distributed objects.  Clients can register with the
 * EM objects to handle specific events.  That will cause a customized
 * routine to be generated on each core, that will register itself
 * with the PIC (programable interrupt controller) on that core.
 * There is a one-to-one correspondence between event numbers and
 * interrupts.  This will allow a dispatch from an interrupt to an EBB
 * to be highly efficient, and conversly all interrupts to be handled
 * on EBBs.  The interrupt routine will buy the EM's rep's stack, and
 * then invoke the handler previously registered for that event with
 * interrupts disabled.
 *
 * The current implementation is very simple, a shared table of
 * handlers, no dynamically generated code yet. ... but wanted to
 * document the plan.
